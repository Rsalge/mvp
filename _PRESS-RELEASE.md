# Project Name #

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Settlers Tracker! An app that is used to take statistics of each player as you play a game of Settlers of Catan.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  For those Catan players who want to look back on a game and see statistics like number of 8s rolled, who ended up with the longest road, who won and by how much, etc.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Have you ever found yourself to be curious exactly how many f***ing 8s were rolled in that last game of Catan? Or perhaps how long the longest road was and who had the second longest(assuming you have already cleared the board)? All these questions can be answered by using Settlers Tracker. Settlers Tracker is a turn-by-turn statistics keeping app. You can track the following individual player stats each turn: dice-roll, number of cities, number of settlements, longest road length, and number of knight cards played. The victory points for each player will be calculated from the stats of that individual player, so if player 1 has two cities and a settlement then their victory points would automatically be updated to 5 VPs. Be careful of hidden VPs like the chapel development card(hidden card that has a value of 1 victory point) though!

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Have you ever been curious how many time certain numbers were rolled in a game? Or perhaps you have trouble properly counting how long the current longest road is? Maybe even knowing how many VPs the other players in your party have(or your own)?

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

All of these issues are resolved with Settlers Tracker, you can see all of this information in one place in a convenient view.
